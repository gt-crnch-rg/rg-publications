<a id="omscs24">**Exploring the Rogues Gallery Testbed for Online Learning**</a>

**Authors:** Sterling Peet, Jeffrey Young

The Rogues Gallery testbed is a novel computer architecture environment sponsored by the National Science Foundation and run by Georgia Tech’s Center for Research into Novel Compute Hierarchies (CRNCH). This testbed is a collaborative effort with PACE and the College of Computing that extends the idea of high-performance computing to new and unique or “rogue” platforms like new GPUs, Arm and RISC-V CPUs, neuromorphic chips, and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). This demonstration provides an overview of how OMSCS students and faculty can access and use resources funded by Georgia Tech’s TechFee program as well as unique capabilities to extend research in the areas of space-compatible hardware and software. Specifically, we will show users how easy it is to run notebook-enabled workflows on the testbed for AI-focused labs and research. Secondly, we will demonstrate an emerging capability for evaluating flight software used by researchers at NASA labs like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Finally, we will share some experiences from OMSCS students working with the Rogues Gallery testbed on evaluating new HPC systems including using the Spatter benchmark, a locally developed tool that is being used for the procurement of next-generation supercomputers at Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories.

The Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP) Program at Georgia Tech provides a multidisciplinary research experience aimed at engaging undergraduate and graduate research students in large-scale computing research projects. Since 2019, the Future Computing with the Rogues Gallery VIP course has engaged over 75 students in research on topics related to novel architectures and "post-Moore" computing platforms built around quantum, neuromorphic, near-memory, and reconfigurable computing.

One of the key takeaways from this course for the course designers has been on the correlation between these novel computing platforms and traditional skills, techniques, and tools that are used in the HPC and parallel computing arenas. We discuss these parallels as well as the impacts of this course on general student success and research outcomes. 

<a id="sehet23">**Multifaceted Approaches for Introducing a Hardware-Thread Migratory Architecture**</a>

**Authors:** Aaron Jezghani, Vedavyas Mallela, Jeffrey Young, Will Powell

The challenges of HPC education span a wide array of targeted applications, ranging from developing a new generation of administrators and facilitators to maintain and support cluster resources and their respective user communities, to broadening the impact of HPCworkflows by reaching non-traditional disciplines and training researchers in the best-practice tools and approaches when using such systems. Furthermore, standard x86 and GPU architectures are becoming untenable to scale to the needs of computational research, necessitating software and hardware co-development on less-familiar processors. While platforms such as Cerebras and SambaNova have matured to include common frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch as well as robust APIs, and thus are amenable to production use cases and instructional material, other systems may lack such infrastructure maturity, impeding all but the most technically inclined developers from being able to leverage the system.

We present here our efforts and outcomes of providing a co-development and instructional platform for the Lucata Pathfinder thread-migratory system in the Rogues Gallery at Georgia Tech. Through a collection of user workflow management, co-development with the platform’s engineers, community tutorials, undergraduate coursework, and student hires, we have been able to explore multiple facets of HPC education in a unique way that can serve as a viable template for others seeking to develop similar efforts.

<a id="pearc22">**Enhancing HPC Education and Workflows with Novel Computing Architectures**</a>

**Authors:** Jeffrey Young, Aaron Jezghani, Jeffrey Valdez, Sam Jijina, Xueyang Liu, William Powell, Michael D. Weiner, Semir Sarajlic

Recent HPC education efforts have focused on maximizing the usage of traditional- and cloud-based computing infrastructures that primarily support CPU or GPU hardware. However, recent innovations in CPU architectures from Arm and RISC-V and the acquisition of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) companies by vendors like Intel and AMD mean that traditional HPC clusters are rapidly becoming more heterogeneous. 

This work investigates one such example deployed at Georgia Tech - a joint workflow for processor design and reconfigurable computing courses supported by both the HPC-focused Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) and GT's novel architecture center, CRNCH. This collaborative workflow of HPC nodes and 40 remotely accessible Pynq devices supported over 100 students in Spring 2022, and its deployment provides key lessons on sticking points and opportunities for combined HPC and novel architecture workflows.

<a id="iwahpce22">**Onboarding Users to A64FX via Open OnDemand**</a>

**Authors:** Aaron Jezghani, Kevin Manalo, William Powell, Jeffrey Valdez, Jeffrey Young

Arm HPC has succeeded in scaling up in the supercomputing space with the deployment of systems like RIKEN's Fugaku supercomputer and Sandia's Astra cluster. At the same time, the onboarding of new users to the Arm HPC ecosystem has never been more complex due to an overabundance of compilers, libraries, and build options for tools and applications. 
 
This work investigates one particular method to ease the integration of new users into the space of Arm HPC through the use of OOD to provide a consistent and easy-to-use front-end for Georgia Tech's A64FX cluster, Octavius. We detail the motivations for this deployment as well as the potential pitfalls in integrating with an Arm A64FX environment. User-motived applications that incorporate the interactive usage of virtual desktops and Jupyter notebooks are discussed as motivating user workflows, and we provide some context on how future deployments might look with combined Arm and OOD integration.

<a id="icrc19">**Experimental Insights from the Rogues Gallery**</a>

**Authors:** Jeffrey Young, Jason Riedy, Prasanth Chatarasi, Sriseshan Srikanth, Thomas M. Conte, Vivek Sarkar

The Rogues Gallery is a new deployment for understanding next-generation hardware with a focus on unorthodox and uncommon technologies. This testbed project was initiated in 2017 in response to Rebooting Computing efforts and initiatives. The Gallery's focus is to acquire new and unique hardware (the rogues) from vendors, research labs, and start-ups and to make this hardware widely available to students, faculty, and industry collaborators within a managed data center environment. By exposing students and researchers to this set of unique hardware, we hope to foster cross-cutting discussions about hardware designs that will drive future performance improvements in computing long after the Moore's Law era of cheap transistors ends. We have defined an initial vision of the infrastructure and driving engineering challenges for such a testbed in a separate document, so here we present highlights of the first one to two years of post-Moore era research with the Rogues Gallery and give an indication of where we see future growth for this testbed and related efforts.

<a id="pearc19">**Wrangling Rogues: A Case Study on Managing Experimental Post-Moore Architectures**</a>

**Authors:** Will Powell, Jason Riedy, Jeffrey S. Young, Thomas M. Conte

The Rogues Gallery is a new experimental testbed that is focused on tackling "rogue" architectures for the Post-Moore era of computing. While some of these devices have roots in the embedded and high-performance computing spaces, managing current and emerging technologies provides a challenge for system administration that are not always foreseen in traditional data center environments.

We present an overview of the motivations and design of the initial Rogues Gallery testbed and cover some of the unique challenges that we have seen and foresee with upcoming hardware prototypes for future post-Moore research. Specifically, we cover the networking, identity management, scheduling of resources, and tools and sensor access aspects of the Rogues Gallery and techniques we have developed to manage these new platforms.
