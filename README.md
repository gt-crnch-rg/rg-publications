Recent HPC education efforts have focused on maximizing the usage of traditional- and cloud-based computing infrastructures that primarily support CPU or GPU hardware. However, recent innovations in CPU architectures from Arm and RISC-V and the acquisition of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) companies by vendors like Intel and AMD mean that traditional HPC clusters are rapidly becoming more heterogeneous. 

This work investigates one such example deployed at Georgia Tech - a joint workflow for processor design and reconfigurable computing courses supported by both the HPC-focused Partnership for an Advanced Computing Environment (PACE) and GT's novel architecture center, CRNCH. This collaborative workflow of HPC nodes and 40 remotely accessible Pynq devices supported over 100 students in Spring 2022, and its deployment provides key lessons on sticking points and opportunities for combined HPC and novel architecture workflows.

Arm HPC has succeeded in scaling up in the supercomputing space with the deployment of systems like RIKEN's Fugaku supercomputer and Sandia's Astra cluster. At the same time, the onboarding of new users to the Arm HPC ecosystem has never been more complex due to an overabundance of compilers, libraries, and build options for tools and applications. 
 
This work investigates one particular method to ease the integration of new users into the space of Arm HPC through the use of OOD to provide a consistent and easy-to-use front-end for Georgia Tech's A64FX cluster, Octavius. We detail the motivations for this deployment as well as the potential pitfalls in integrating with an Arm A64FX environment. User-motived applications that incorporate the interactive usage of virtual desktops and Jupyter notebooks are discussed as motivating user workflows, and we provide some context on how future deployments might look with combined Arm and OOD integration.

<a id="pearc19">**Wrangling Rogues: A Case Study on Managing Experimental Post-Moore Architectures</a>

**Authors:** Will Powell, Jason Riedy, Jeffrey S. Young, Thomas M. Conte

The Rogues Gallery is a new experimental testbed that is focused on tackling "rogue" architectures for the Post-Moore era of computing. While some of these devices have roots in the embedded and high-performance computing spaces, managing current and emerging technologies provides a challenge for system administration that are not always foreseen in traditional data center environments.

We present an overview of the motivations and design of the initial Rogues Gallery testbed and cover some of the unique challenges that we have seen and foresee with upcoming hardware prototypes for future post-Moore research. Specifically, we cover the networking, identity management, scheduling of resources, and tools and sensor access aspects of the Rogues Gallery and techniques we have developed to manage these new platforms.
